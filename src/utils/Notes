These are important notes

If npm start doesn't work, check your Json file and debug npm start.

Quickly CD to Json server folder:
cd ~/Desktop/NucampFolder/json-server

The "Run Server" command for the Json server is:
json-server -H 0.0.0.0 --watch db.json -p 3001 -d 2000

YOU MUST RUN THE ABOVE COMMAND IN ORDER FOR THE SITE TO WORK.
